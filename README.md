## Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent microvascular complication occurring due to diabetes mellitus. It affects the blood vessels inside the retina, potentially causing vision loss or complete blindness if left untreated. Currently, doctors examine and classify the severity of DR based on manual interpretations of fundus images, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project aims to automate this process using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of fundus images collected from Malpani Eye Hospital And Laser Centre in Santacruz, Mumbai, India. The dataset includes:

- **Raw Dataset**: 102 high-quality images
  - 52 fundus images of patients with varying grades of DR
  - 50 fundus images of patients with healthy retinas

- **Augmented Dataset**: 703 images created using augmentation techniques
  - 350 fundus images of patients with DR
  - 353 fundus images of patients with healthy retinas

The augmentation techniques used include:
- Horizontal Flipping
- Vertical Flipping
- Rotation
- Changing Brightness
- Shearing

## Models Implemented
This project implements and compares several deep learning models:

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Three custom CNN architectures were implemented and tested:
- **CNN V3**: A basic implementation of a convolutional neural network for DR detection
- **CNN V7**: An improved CNN architecture with additional layers and optimizations
- **CNN V9-Raw**: CNN model tested on the raw (non-augmented) dataset

### 2. Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet)
Four DenseNet experiments were conducted using pre-trained models:
- **DenseNet 121**: Tested on both augmented and raw datasets
- **DenseNet 169**: Tested on both augmented and raw datasets, with further optimization in the "-2" version

### 3. Residual Network (ResNet)
- **ResNet 50**: Implemented and tested on both augmented and raw datasets

## Results
Performance comparison of the models:

| Model | Raw Dataset |  | Augmented Dataset |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Training Accuracy (%) | Testing Accuracy (%) | Training Accuracy (%) | Testing Accuracy (%) |
| Custom CNN 1 | 95.9 | 87.5 | 100 | 82.08 |
| Custom CNN 2 | 100 | 87.5 | 100 | 81.13 |
| DenseNet 121 | 92.75 | 81.25 | 97.78 | 94.34 |
| DenseNet 169 | 97.14 | 93.75 | 98.97 | 97.17 |
| ResNet 50 | 67.7 | 50 | 73.95 | 72.64 |

DenseNet 169 demonstrated the best performance with a testing accuracy of 97.17% on the augmented dataset.

Due to privacy considerations, the raw dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can:
1. Use your own fundus images
2. Access publicly available DR datasets such as APTOS 2019 or EyePACS
